## window.itemlist

Array that goes like this: [number, string, object, (number, string, object, number, string, object...)]
Each 3 array items is a game inventory item (meaning it can be literally a thing, a key or an event sighting)
First position indicates inventory slot for this thing, it starts with 1, because 0 means you did not obtain this item.
Second position indicates in-game tecnhical code for this item, like "BIRTH" meaning birth certificate or "PURSE" meaning purse. Events have names like in audio directory: "A1" etc
Third position indicates object with the following properties:
- `a`: Array of 0s and 1s indicating which ghosts answered about this item (1st is Amy, 2nd is DrBose, 3rd is Harvey, 4th is )
- `t`: Type where 1 means a thing (like bottles), 2 means a sighting (like Amy appearance), 3 means ghost's answer, 4 means key (including store rooms and guestkeys), 5 means a scrying mirror, 6 means compass, 
- `n`: Array of names. For some reason the 1st item is name in english localization, 2nd is Spanish and 3rd is Dutch
- `o` (only keys): which room number does this key open, for store rooms always equals to 99


Use this function to parse itemlist to human-readable format:
```js
Array(Math.ceil(itemlist.length / 3)).fill().map((_, index) => index * 3).map(begin => itemlist.slice(begin, begin + 3))
  .map(([inventorySlot, code, item]) => ({
      code,
      obtained: inventorySlot > 0,
      ...(inventorySlot > 0 && { inventorySlot }),
      type: { 1: 'item', 2: 'event', 3: 'ghost_answer', 4: 'key', 5: 'scrying_mirror', 6: 'compass' }[item.t],
      name: item.n?.[0],
      ...(item.t === 4 && { keyForRoom: item.o }),
      answers: { Amy: item.a?.[0] === 1, DrBose: item.a?.[0] === 1, Harvey: item.a?.[0] === 1, Rose: item.a?.[0] === 1 },
      ...(item.rp && { locatedIn: item.rp }),
  }))
```
It returns the following format:
```ts
type Result = {
  // Technical internal code for this item
  code: string
  obtained: boolean
  // Number of slot in inventory, starting from 1
  inventorySlot?: number
  name: string
  type: 'item' | 'event' | 'ghost_answer' | 'key' | 'scrying_mirror' | 'compass'
  // Only for type === 'key'
  keyForRoom?: number
  // Which ghosts answered about this item
  answers: {
    Amy: boolean
    DrBose: boolean
    Harvey: boolean
    Rose: boolean
  }
  // Where it is located. Array is: room number or 0, drawer code or 'X'
  locatedIn?: [number, string]
}[]
```

## window.vids

Complete list of all videos, positions with internal scenes names and audios that should be played

Structure:

Array of 3 elements concatenated into a single 1-level deep list:
0 - Fragment name
1 - Duration in seconds (0 for some fragments)
2 - Starting position in hotel.m4v in seconds (11268 for some fragments)
3 - Information about that fragment:
`o` — change compass orientation (can be `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`)
`audVers` — one of the following audios should be played (randomly), structure: concatenated arrays of name of audio in string, some number (usually low such as 0.1 or 0.4). Also first two items are some digits. Example: [1, 0, "RunM1", 0.1, "RunM2", 0.1]
`aud` — play that exact audio by specified filename
`vl` — which fragment should play immediately after that fragment, if not specified, this fragment should loop
`rv` — if this is present, video timestamps of specified fragment should be used instead of this fragment's

### Fragments naming

For normal non-cutscene fragments, they are usually named like XXYY and then some additional data, where X and Y stand for coordinates. When Maya is just staring forward, they use this suffix: `-[O]H` where `[O]` is orientation, e.g. `S` for south. For example, `8021-WH` will play fragment where Maya stares into a west corridor on ground floor (as 80 prefix means ground floor). For rotation, they use `-[O]L` or `-[O]R` for rotating left and right. For moving between coordinates, they use `XXYY-XXYY` (different coordinates separated by `-`), for example `8021-8020`.

To test any fragment, type `window.govid('[name]')` for example `window.govid('ROOM V7-F SPY R3')`
